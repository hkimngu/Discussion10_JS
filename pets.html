            <h2>Omelette</h2>
            <img src="images/omelette.jpg" width = "400" alt="Yellow Cockatiel standing on the ground with a pink background">

            <p>
                I have no idea how old he is, but he is a baby in my heart. He is yellow like an omelette hence the name. 
                He has cute rosy cheeks, like tomatoes on an omelette.
            </p> 
            <p>
                He is a cockatiel that my cousin couldn't keep anymore, so my cousin just dropped him off at my place without
                telling me, and I just went home one day and found a bird in my house. I wasn't exactly looking for a pet, 
                but I just kinda roll with it. He was an unexpected addition to my life, but it's okay, I love him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He loves stealing. I don't know how, I don't know when, but whenever I come home there's something new
                that was not there before. I would come home to buttons, coins, wires that does not belong to me and I would
                find them in his cage. Lately it's been progressively larger items. I once came home to a flat screen TV before, 
                so I'm not complaining.
            </p>

            <img src="images/toast_in_sunlight.jpg" width = "400" alt="A brown cat sitting in sunlight">

            <p>
                This is Toast. He is 2 year old cat, but acts like he's 100. He is a British Shorthair
                cat with soft cinnamon brown fur. His nickname is Cinnamon Toast Crunch. He always looks tired,
                hence, why I think he's a million years old. I call him an old man, but I love him.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I found him as a kitten on the side of the road nibbling on a piece of toast. We named him after that, 
                also that his favorite thing is toast. He's not supposed to have or eat toast, but somehow he gets it.
                I don't even make toast, and sometimes I don't even ahve bread in the house, but somehow when I see him, 
                he has a slice of toast in his mouth.
            </p>
            <P>
                He likes lounging on the couch and is very affectionate, dispite his grumpy man persona. He still very much
                loves toast even as an adult now. He gets grumpy and pouty when he doesn't get his way.
            </p>

            <h2>Butter</h2>
            <img src="images/butter_wood_bkgd.jpg" width = "400" alt="A orange hamster looking up with a wood background">

            <p>
                This is Butter. I have no idea how old she is, but she's a hamster. 
                She is a orange-yellow-beige color. I think she might be a dwarf hamster?
                However, I don't know enough about hamsters to know exactly what breed she is.
                She is very stupid and I worry about her accidentally finding her way to the pearly
                gates of pet heaven, but I love her.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I wanted a hamster one day, so I got one. She loves Toast. Not the bread. Toast the 
                Cat. Toast tolerates her, and isn't interested in eating her, thank goodness for that.
                Because she loves sticking with Toast, her name became Butter, since I think she would
                like a matching name with her best buddy. 
            </p>
            <P>
                She loves the hamster wheel and playing with Toast. She likes to bother Toast a lot 
                while Toast naps. She like to get into shenanigans, and I worry about her accidentally
                wandering off to her death. She's not the brightest animal, but somehow Death spares her
                despite the multiple close-case scenarios.

            <p>
                This is Link. His full name is Sausage Link. He is a ferret and he is a year old. 
                He is a brown gray color. He is wiggly and a little greasy and loves to break my stuff, but 
                I love him.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I wanted more pets. Once I had three I couldn't help myself anymore. I recognize I may have
                a problem, and I ackwoledge it, but I have elected to let myself fall into the obessession instead 
                of fighting it. So, I got a ferret. I have a breakfast theme going on so hence the name, Sausage Link.
            </p>
            <P>
                He like running and jumping around. He also like to destroy my pots. He somehow always finds little 
                knick-knacks I didn't know I have? Like a bunch of little gems, some seeds, sometimes mini swords.
            </p>

            <h2>Waffle</h2>

            <p>
                This is Waffle. I also have no idea how old she is, but she's a very very very old tortise. 
                She is a sage color. She is craves violence, but I love her.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Waffle is also named after a breakfast food. I found her outside a Waffle house. She tried to bite my fingers off, and I knew
                I had to bring her home with me.
            </p>
            <P>
                She's a cranky old woman and she hates me, but I love her. She likes headbutting me and trying to bite me, but I'm used to it. 
                I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and she's inches away from me with a knife strapped on her shell, but I 
                want to think it's her way of expressing her love.
            </p>
